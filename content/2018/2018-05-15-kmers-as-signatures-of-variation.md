My recent research has been motivated by two related questions.

1. Can we discover genetic variants without aligning reads to a reference genome?
2. Can we quickly find shared or unique variants that are unlikely to be found using any reference-based approach?

Both questions speak to pragmatic concerns as well as considerations of curiosity and novelty.
On the pragmatic side, *poorly represented population diversity; non-model reference quality*.
On the curiosity side, we've suspected for a long time that variant discovery without read mapping is possible, but 



These questions both address practical issues with variant discovery and analysis as well as

On the practical side, 

The first question speaks to a variety of practical problems.
