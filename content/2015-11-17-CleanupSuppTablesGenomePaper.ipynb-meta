Summary: We submitted a genome paper to Genome Biology over the weekend. I'm going
    through our repository and tidying things up, and I realized I have not had
    a chance to record my notes on several of the supplemental tables providing
    a comparison of genome features across seven species. I'll go ahead and do
    so here.
