The big priority with kevlar right now: get it working!

No, seriously.

A couple of months ago I was getting reasonable results: some false postives, but mostly reliable novel mutations.
But that was before I discovered The Bug. The Filtering Bug.

A bunch of data was being inappropriately discarded due to a silly programming mistake.
The bug was simple enough to fix, and a barrage of regression tests are now in place to make absolutely positively sure that another similar bug will *probably* never happen.
But since then, I haven't been able to produce anything remotely reasonable on a human data set.
For many variants reported by kevlar, the number of reads supporting the variant in the proband is much lower than the required threshold.
I observed the same behavior in a small test data set from rice.
This turned out to be the result of a short repetitive k-mer occurring many times in a single read, but this doesn't appear to be the case with the human data.
