The [NCBI Transcript Shotgun Assembly database](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/tsa) is the go-to place for submitting transcript assemblies for long-term archival and public access.
However, `TSA` is not one of the database options provided when doing keyword searches at NCBI.
TSA sequences are available through the `nuccore` nucleotide database, along with all other DNA and RNA sequences.

If you want to search NCBI exclusively for TSA records, include `tsa-master[prop]` in your query.
For example, if you want to look for TSA records for the wasp *Polistes metricus*, select the `Nucleotide` database and use the query `tsa-master[prop] AND "Polistes metricus"[Organism]`.
Similarly, the query `tsa-master[prop] AND Polistes[Organism]` will search the entire genus.
The final entry of each TSA master record is a `TSA` attribute, with a link to download the sequences in compressed Fasta format.
