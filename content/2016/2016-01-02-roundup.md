Summary: Roundup of links to interesting Christmas/New Year holiday reads.

## [This eye-opening post about relationships in academics...](http://sasconfidential.com/2016/01/02/academic-scattering/)

...and the disproportionate pressure on women who hope to have children.

> I doubt any selection committee would admit on-record to thinking a family-free candidate is “perfect”.
> Nonetheless, the traditional academic career structure is built around an assumption of mobility that is hard to maintain with any kind of relationships or dependents.
> I’m still trying to figure out if I can manage to keep a pet.

## [This thread on Hacker News about video-based MOOCs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10822376)

I've participated in two MOOCs, but didn't complete either.
I have mixed feelings about the use of video to present the material.
In some cases, I could easily do without it.
But in other cases I think it was helpful.
Also, the types of autodidacts (many/most with a strong technical background already) that thrive in MOOCs may not need/want video as much as the average learner that would really benefit the most from a free or low-cost course.

> As of 2016, I realised that video based courses in Coursera and Udemy are not ideal and are a drain on efficiency.
> You cannot skim through content in videos and you are constantly wondering what you will miss if you forward the video.
> You will have to adjust to lecturer's speed rather than choose your own speed.
> You cannot listen to videos in noisy environments.

## [This study on whether mom's kisses really do make owies feel better](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26711672/)

> BACKGROUND: The practice of maternal kissing of minor injuries of childhood (boo-boos), though widely endorsed and practised, has never been demonstrated to be of benefit to children.
> 
> OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy, if any, of maternal kissing of boo-boos in toddlers.

## [This piece from The Guardian about one case in which data sharing can be harmful](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/01/poachers-using-science-papers-to-target-newly-discovered-species)

> But earlier this year, an announcement in the [Zootaxa](http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/) academic journal that two new species of large gecko [had been found in southern China](http://dx.doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.3980.1.4) contained a strange omission: the species’ whereabouts.
> 
> “Due to the popularity of this genus as novelty pets, and recurring cases of scientific descriptions driving herpetofauna to near-extinction by commercial collectors, we do not disclose the collecting localities of these restricted-range species in this publication,” the paper said.

## [This blog post on getting a faculty position](http://ecoevoevoeco.blogspot.ca/2016/01/resolution-i-will-get-faculty-position.html)

> Now, I know what you are thinking – “Yuk, I don’t want a job at the University of Southwestern Northern Nunavut.”
> Neither do I, but here is the important thing to remember: **You are not marrying your institution – you are dating it**.
> If you don’t like it, you can leave – at any time and for any reason.
> The key is to get yourself into a job where you can prove your abilities as an independent researcher, get your start-up money, get a grant, do some teaching, and so on.
> That can happen at nearly any university in nearly any state or country.

## [This (paywalled?!?!) article about the NHGRI possibly terminating funding for several model organism databases](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/351/6268/14.full)

> NHGRI Director Eric Green says that nothing has been decided and that rumors that his institute plans to phase out all of its funding are incorrect.
> But he and other NIH leaders are searching for ways to make the databases more efficient, and are urging databases to consider charging for use.

## [This latest BLAST+ release note from NCBI](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK131777/)

With the upgrade from version 2.2.x to 2.3.x they have added provisional support for SAM output format.

## [This pre-print on amplification bias in RNA-seq](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/12/28/035493)

Need to read!

> Computationally, read duplicates are defined via their mapping position, which does not distinguish PCR from natural duplicates that are bound to occur for highly transcribed RNAs.
> Hence, it is unclear how to treat duplicate reads and how important it is to reduce PCR amplification experimentally.
> Here, we generate and analyse RNA-Seq datasets that were prepared with three different protocols (Smart-Seq, TruSeq and UMI-seq).

## [This blog post on Netflix's new video compression strategy](https://donmelton.com/2015/12/21/what-the-new-video-compression-strategy-from-netflix-means-for-apple-and-amazon/)

> The tl;dr of it all is simply that Netflix plans on scaling bitrates up and down based on the complexity of their video.
> So, slightly higher bitrates for busy action blockbusters and possibly lower bitrates for relatively static, flat cartoons.
> 
> Basically what we’ve all been doing for years with variable bitrate (VBR) encoding.
> But they’re trying to control that variance a lot more than an encoder like x264 typically allows.
> In fact, as near as I can tell, Netflix still plans on encoding everything with a constant bitrate (CBR), but they want to be really particular about the target number.
> 
> To do that, Netflix will transcode every one of their videos a bazillion times at different resolutions and at different bitrates, finally selecting the smallest one for a particular title that doesn’t suck visually.
> Seriously, their algorithm for all of this is quite clever.

## [This open-source OCR engine on GitHub](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)

Found over Christmas break while chatting to family about OCR.
By the way, it's available in [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)!
