My affiliation recently changed from Indiana University to UC Davis, and accordingly my IU credentials no longer give me access to the eduroam wifi network.
Over the last couple of days I've been struggling to connect my laptop to eduroam using my new UC Davis credentials.
At first I thought the it was an issue with my account, but it turns out it was simply an issue with a profile saved on the system.

When I first connected to eduroam with my IU credentials on my MacBook Pro several years ago, it stored a "profile" on the system.
On my phone, "forgetting" the eduroam network was sufficient for deleting this profile, but on the laptop, disconnecting or "forgetting" the network didn't solve the issue.
With a bit of searching, I was able to find the profile in the `Network` section of `System Preferences`, but this provided no way to remove the profile (as had been suggested on several forums for older versions of OS X)!

Finally, I was able to find the profile in a different subsection of the `System Preferences` (aptly named `Profiles`, go figure), and there was able to delete the profile.
I was then able to connect to the eduroam network, provide my UC Davis credentials, and successfully connect.
It doesn't look like UC Davis stored a profile on the system, so hopefully I don't have to deal with this issue again!
