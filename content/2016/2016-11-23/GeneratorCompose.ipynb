    "> When the function reaches a `return` statement, the local variables are destroyed and the value is returned to the caller.\n",
    "> A later call to the same function creates a new private namespace and a fresh set of local variables.\n",
    "> But, what if the local variables werenâ€™t thrown away on exiting a function?\n",

    "The `GtNodeStream` is similar conceptually to Python generators in that it implements lazy (on-demand) evaluation and retains state between calls (it also requires quite a lot of code to implement and use).\n",
    "The real power of node streams, as explained very well in the [GenomeTools paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2013.68), is that they can be *composed*.\n",
    "Any bit of data processing can be implemented as a custom node stream, and then larger data processing tasks can be addressed by chaining node streams together.\n",
    "I found this pattern to be a very valuable way to decompose large analysis tasks into smaller more manageable chunks.\n",
    "\n",
