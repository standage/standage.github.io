Summary: Roundup of links to interesting reads from the last couple of weeks.

## [This paper about a single nucleotide exon in *Arabidopsis*](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep18087)

> Here we report that the *Anaphase Promoting Complex subunit 11 (APC11)* gene in *Arabidopsis thaliana* carries a constitutive single-nucleotide exon.
> *In vivo* transcription and translation assays performed using *APC11-Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP)* fusion constructs revealed that intron splicing surrounding the single-nucleotide exon is effective in both *Arabidopsis* and rice.

## [This (older) post about academic software...](http://phdops.kblin.org/software-dev-intellectual-contribution.html)

...which spurred some of [my own writing](https://standage.github.io/misconceptions-about-research-software.html) this week.

> I would argue that the analogy with wet lab work would be that **designing experiments** is like **designing software**, and **conducting experiments** is like **implementing software**.
> Now if we follow the general agreement that designing experiments is a valuable intellectual input to the scientific endeavour, by analogy so should designing software.

## [This interview about computer scientists needing to speaking out about cryptography](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/12/the-moral-failure-of-computer-science/420012/)

> **Waddell**: In your paper, you compare the debate over nuclear science in the 1950s to the current debate over cryptography.
> Nuclear weapons are one of the most obvious threats to humanity today—do you think surveillance presents a similar type of danger?
>
> **Rogaway**: I do. It’s of a different nature, obviously.
> The threat is more indirect and more subtle.
> So with nuclear warfare, there was this visually compelling and frightening risk of going up in a mushroom cloud.
> And with the transition to a state of total surveillance, what we have is just the slow forfeiture of democracy.

## [This long read on whether PLOS will enforce their data sharing policy](https://jcoynester.wordpress.com/2015/12/13/why-i-dont-know-how-plos-will-respond-to-authors-refusal-to-release-data)

> King’s College London doesn’t want to release data to James Coyne from a study of chronic fatigue syndrome.
> See if the absurd reasons make your blood boil as much as ours:
>> *The university considers that there is a lack of value or serious purpose to your request.
>> The university also considers that there is improper motive behind the request.
>> The university considers that this request has caused and could further cause harassment and distress to staff.*

## [These thoughts about how recommendation engines might improve or replace journals](http://www.evocellnet.com/2015/12/replace-journals-with-recommendation.html)

> One way to replace the current system, by something less frustrating, would be to use automated recommendation engines.
> I have tried Google Scholar recommendations and Pubchase and both work really well.
> If we want to get rid of journals we need to figure out a way for such automated systems to mimic the journal's transfer of knowledge within and across communities.
