Hi, I'm Daniel, a research scientist with interests in genome informatics, specifically variant discovery and genome annotation.
I am committed to open, transparent, and reproducible research, and to responsible research software engineering.
I also enjoy mentoring and teaching, both in the classroom and in less structured settings.

If you're interested in my research experience, take a look at my [CV](pages/cv.html).

I've written a few notes here about [my teaching experience and philosopy](pages/teaching.html).

Take a look at the [open source research software projects](pages/software.html) I've created and contributed to.

Musings about research and computing are posted (infrequently) to [my notebook](notebook.html).
