I'm Daniel, a bioinformatics scientist with interests in DNA, genes, genomes, and software.
My current role focuses on microbial and human forensics.
My prior experience covers a broad range of genomics research:
developing methods and software for variant discovery;
assembling, annotating, and profiling the genome of a model insect species;
and developing methods and software to annotate genomes and investigate genome composition and organization.
I am committed to open, transparent, and reproducible research, and to responsible research software engineering.
I also enjoy mentoring and teaching.
