Hi, I'm Daniel, a research scientist with interests in bioinformatics, genome biology, and research software engineering.
I am committed to open, transparent, and reproducible research, and to established software engineering practices to the extent that they facilitate these ends.
I also enjoy mentoring and teaching, both in the classroom and in less structured settings.

## Research

My research focuses primarily on leveraging annotated genome sequences to better understand eukaryotic genome composition and organization.
I split my research effort between developing tools for managing and querying genome annotations, and applying these tools to characterize genomic features.
I am especially interested in comparative genomics, and in species of agricultural significanceâ€”most of my work has focused on plant and insect genomics.

I recently joined Titus Brown's [Lab for Data Intensive Biology](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/) at the University of California, Davis after completing a Ph.D. in the research groups of [Volker Brendel (Indiana University)](http://brendelgroup.org/) and [Amy Toth (Iowa State University)](http://www.public.iastate.edu/~amytoth/Toth_lab/Home.html).
See my [curriculum vitae]({filename}cv.md) for additional details about my education and scholarship.

## Teaching

My approach to teaching mirrors the way I personally learn: teach fundamental principles with very basic exercises, and then provide space to extend those principles and synthesize new knowledge, building on the basics.
I have been involved in a teaching capacity in variety of courses and workshops, with content ranging from computational genomics to basic biology to scientific computing.

See my [teaching statement]({filename}teaching.md) for additional details on my teaching and training activities.

## Software & Databases

Creating software and databases is a big part of my research.
I work hard to make these resources accessible, reliable, and re-purposeable, as a matter not only of obligation as a publicly funded scientist, but also of scientific integrity.

See my [software/database catalog]({filename}software.md) for more details.

## Notebook

I have used blogs, wikis, and web documents for several years to keep an electronic "lab notebook" of my research activities.
I am transitioning to a new platform that will allow me to more easily integrate code, data visualization, and related discussion.
