### [AEGeAn Toolkit](http://standage.github.io/AEGeAn/)

I am the primary developer of the AEGeAn Toolkit, an integrated toolkit for anlaysis and evaluation of genome annotations.
AEGeAn includes a collection of programs and scripts, as well as a C library whose API provides access to all of AEGeAn's core functions and data structures.

### [HymHub](http://brendelgroup.github.io/HymHub/)

I created the HymHub database to support my comparative genomics work in the Hymenoptera.
HymHub includes data for over 16 species of Hymenoptera (and related outgroups), as well as the scripts used to download the data from disparate primary sources and standardize the format.

### [GenomeTools Library](http://genometools.org/)

I am an avid user of and contributor to the GenomeTools library, a collection of excellent genome informatics tools.
Most of my contributions come in the form of small patches, bug reports, and feature requests, although I have implemented one core data structure.

In many ways GenomeTools served as a model for my development of the AEGeAn Toolkit.
The GenomeTools development community is small but active, and were very accomodating when I first starting using their API, and then later when I began patching and extending it.
I can thank these kind folks for most of what I know about software engineering!

### [khmer Library](http://khmer.readthedocs.org/)

I am a frequent user of the khmer library, and contributed several new features during the khmer code sprint at Pycon 2015 in Montreal.
The khmer library is also an excellent model of research software development, in terms of both process and community engagement.
