## Teaching

**Computational Genome Science <small>(Fall 2011, Spring 2013, Spring 2014, Spring 2015, Spring 2016)</small>**

Graduate course covering the full range of computational genomics analysis: quality control, read mapping, expression profiling, genome assembly, transcript assembly, and annotation.
The class provides brief exposure to relevant theory, but focuses primarily on installing and running software and (most importantly) critical analysis and biological interpretation of results.
I helped develop the course in 2011, and since 2013 I have been the primary instructor.

**Science of Biology, Honors <small>(Spring 2007, Spring 2008)</small>**

As an undergraduate I was a teaching assistant for Prof. Craig Coleman's Biol 120H class.
This class provided a comprehensive introduction to the biological sciences, with modules for biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, cell biology, and evolution.
The course focused on learning the scientific method with computer-based experiment simulations, and had a heavy emphasis on writing.
