Summary: Roundup of links to interesting reads from the last couple of weeks.

## [This PLoS ONE paper about stable identifiers for genome projects](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0128026)

> When working on an ongoing genome sequencing and assembly project, it is rather inconvenient when gene identifiers change from one build of the assembly to the next.
> The gene labelling system described here, UniqTag, addresses this common challenge.
> UniqTag assigns a unique identifier to each gene that is a representative *k*-mer, a string of length *k*, selected from the sequence of that gene.
> Unlike serial numbers, these identifiers are stable between different assemblies and annotations of the same data without requiring that previous annotations be lifted over by sequence alignment.
> We assign UniqTag identifiers to ten builds of the Ensembl human genome spanning eight years to demonstrate this stability.

## [This web app for learning the shell in your browser!](http://rik.smith-unna.com/command_line_bootcamp)

> The bootcamp tutorial text was adapted from [the original](http://rescuedbycode.com/linux-bootcamp) by [Keith Bradnam](http://www.keithbradnam.com/).

## [This checklist of common spreadsheat mistakes](http://www.datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/02-common-mistakes.html)

Excel is an arguably horrible tool for data management, but it's a starting place for many scientists.
Great guidelines on how to make the spreadsheet a lot less of a frustrating experience.

## [This quote on academic salesmanship](https://michaeltomasson.wordpress.com/2015/12/03/one-reason-you-didnt-get-that-grant-is-because-theranos)

> Once upon a time, I assumed that excellent work would transcend the need for clever marketing and charismatic presentation to sell it to the proper audience, but the longer I work in science, the more I see examples of necessary hard work labeled as incremental and dismissed and attention lavished on the well constructed story.
> The veracity of which appears secondary, or is assumed.

## [This from *Genome Biology* on self-serving motivations for reproducible research](http://www.genomebiology.com/2015/16/1/274)

> And so, my fellow scientists: ask not what you can do for reproducibility; ask what reproducibility can do for you!
> Here, I present five reasons why working reproducibly pays off in the long run and is in the self-interest of every ambitious, career-oriented scientist.

## [This quote about DOIs and citability](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2013/06/03/DOI-citable.html)

> So what do we mean when we say a DOI makes something ‘citable?’
> If this is shorthand for the properties we would want in something citable: persistent identifier, archival content, machine-readable metadata, than we should start to recognize other things that share these features.
> Further innovation requires valuing the features the DOI provides, not simply a “brand name” researchers recognize.
