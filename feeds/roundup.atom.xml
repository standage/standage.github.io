&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trend will be familiar to anyone who has looked at admission rates to top universities.
Despite ever-rising tuition costs and the growth of much-cheaper online alternatives, the highest-status universities keep getting more selective.
The best way to understand this, I think, is to see both academic journals and top universities less as purveyors of information or knowledge than as dispensers of status.
Information may want to be free, but status will always be scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2016-sustaining-research-software-development.html"&gt;This blog post on sustaining research software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software is fast becoming a &lt;em&gt;sine qua non&lt;/em&gt; in research, and researchers and funding agencies have been trying with increasing urgency to figure out how to support sustainable software development.
There's a whole NSF program devoted to sustainable research software, and I think it's fair to say that one of the main subsurface goals of the BD2K program is to tackle the question of software (PSA: data isn't much use without software).
The USDA and bio bits of DOE are also running smack into the problem that the research programs they fund are utterly dependent on software, yet investments in software are often secondary and rarely yield software that is usable past the end of the grant.
It turns out that software development for research is a rather intransigent beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/11/16/031930.abstract"&gt;This preprint on the state of software in (evolutionary) biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A topic that has received little attention in this context is the code quality of widely used codes.
Unfortunately, the majority of users tend to blindly trust software and the results it produces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://drhagen.com/blog/the-missing-11th-of-the-month/"&gt;This interesting analysis of references to dates and a suprising effect from OCR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where did the rest of the missing 11th go?
Well, starting in the 1860s, the Google algorithm starts to make a rather peculiar error—it misreads 11th as nth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2015/nov/26/why-combining-science-and-showmanship-risks-the-future-of-research"&gt;This Guardian article on showmanship in science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many years, medicine, dinosaurs, space travel, and human origins have all been highly visible and widely entertaining scientific topics.
And for many years, we have relied on evaluation by editorial and professional peer review in scientific journals, evaluative reporting by science journalists, and individual judgment of educated citizens to place new scientific claims into proper perspective.
?Under those conditions, the trend toward science showmanship was arguably tolerable because it usually rested on a foundation of solid science.
When it doesn’t, it becomes bad reality TV that pleases sponsors but shouldn’t be confused for knowledge about process or result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Jupyter notebooks are stored in JSON format, this converts them to Markdown for diffs you can actually interpret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study at Google found five key dynamics that make for successful teams within the company: psychological safety, dependability, structure &amp;amp; clarity, meaning of work, and impact of work.
These findings can be adapted to improving research group dynamics in academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...and the disproportionate pressure on women who hope to have children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt any selection committee would admit on-record to thinking a family-free candidate is “perfect”.
Nonetheless, the traditional academic career structure is built around an assumption of mobility that is hard to maintain with any kind of relationships or dependents.
I’m still trying to figure out if I can manage to keep a pet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10822376"&gt;This thread on Hacker News about video-based MOOCs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've participated in two MOOCs, but didn't complete either.
I have mixed feelings about the use of video to present the material.
In some cases, I could easily do without it.
But in other cases I think it was helpful.
Also, the types of autodidacts (many/most with a strong technical background already) that thrive in MOOCs may not need/want video as much as the average learner that would really benefit the most from a free or low-cost course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2016, I realised that video based courses in Coursera and Udemy are not ideal and are a drain on efficiency.
You cannot skim through content in videos and you are constantly wondering what you will miss if you forward the video.
You will have to adjust to lecturer's speed rather than choose your own speed.
You cannot listen to videos in noisy environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26711672/"&gt;This study on whether mom's kisses really do make owies feel better&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND: The practice of maternal kissing of minor injuries of childhood (boo-boos), though widely endorsed and practised, has never been demonstrated to be of benefit to children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy, if any, of maternal kissing of boo-boos in toddlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But earlier this year, an announcement in the &lt;a href="http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/"&gt;Zootaxa&lt;/a&gt; academic journal that two new species of large gecko &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.3980.1.4"&gt;had been found in southern China&lt;/a&gt; contained a strange omission: the species’ whereabouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Due to the popularity of this genus as novelty pets, and recurring cases of scientific descriptions driving herpetofauna to near-extinction by commercial collectors, we do not disclose the collecting localities of these restricted-range species in this publication,” the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I know what you are thinking – “Yuk, I don’t want a job at the University of Southwestern Northern Nunavut.”
Neither do I, but here is the important thing to remember: &lt;strong&gt;You are not marrying your institution – you are dating it&lt;/strong&gt;.
If you don’t like it, you can leave – at any time and for any reason.
The key is to get yourself into a job where you can prove your abilities as an independent researcher, get your start-up money, get a grant, do some teaching, and so on.
That can happen at nearly any university in nearly any state or country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/351/6268/14.full"&gt;This (paywalled?!?!) article about the NHGRI possibly terminating funding for several model organism databases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHGRI Director Eric Green says that nothing has been decided and that rumors that his institute plans to phase out all of its funding are incorrect.
But he and other NIH leaders are searching for ways to make the databases more efficient, and are urging databases to consider charging for use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need to read!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computationally, read duplicates are defined via their mapping position, which does not distinguish PCR from natural duplicates that are bound to occur for highly transcribed RNAs.
Hence, it is unclear how to treat duplicate reads and how important it is to reduce PCR amplification experimentally.
Here, we generate and analyse RNA-Seq datasets that were prepared with three different protocols (Smart-Seq, TruSeq and UMI-seq).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tl;dr of it all is simply that Netflix plans on scaling bitrates up and down based on the complexity of their video.
So, slightly higher bitrates for busy action blockbusters and possibly lower bitrates for relatively static, flat cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically what we’ve all been doing for years with variable bitrate (VBR) encoding.
But they’re trying to control that variance a lot more than an encoder like x264 typically allows.
In fact, as near as I can tell, Netflix still plans on encoding everything with a constant bitrate (CBR), but they want to be really particular about the target number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do that, Netflix will transcode every one of their videos a bazillion times at different resolutions and at different bitrates, finally selecting the smallest one for a particular title that doesn’t suck visually.
Seriously, their algorithm for all of this is quite clever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we report that the &lt;em&gt;Anaphase Promoting Complex subunit 11 (APC11)&lt;/em&gt; gene in &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/em&gt; carries a constitutive single-nucleotide exon.
&lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; transcription and translation assays performed using &lt;em&gt;APC11-Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP)&lt;/em&gt; fusion constructs revealed that intron splicing surrounding the single-nucleotide exon is effective in both &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/em&gt; and rice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would argue that the analogy with wet lab work would be that &lt;strong&gt;designing experiments&lt;/strong&gt; is like &lt;strong&gt;designing software&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;conducting experiments&lt;/strong&gt; is like &lt;strong&gt;implementing software&lt;/strong&gt;.
Now if we follow the general agreement that designing experiments is a valuable intellectual input to the scientific endeavour, by analogy so should designing software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waddell&lt;/strong&gt;: In your paper, you compare the debate over nuclear science in the 1950s to the current debate over cryptography.
Nuclear weapons are one of the most obvious threats to humanity today—do you think surveillance presents a similar type of danger?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogaway&lt;/strong&gt;: I do. It’s of a different nature, obviously.
The threat is more indirect and more subtle.
So with nuclear warfare, there was this visually compelling and frightening risk of going up in a mushroom cloud.
And with the transition to a state of total surveillance, what we have is just the slow forfeiture of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;King’s College London doesn’t want to release data to James Coyne from a study of chronic fatigue syndrome.
See if the absurd reasons make your blood boil as much as ours:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The university considers that there is a lack of value or serious purpose to your request.
The university also considers that there is improper motive behind the request.
The university considers that this request has caused and could further cause harassment and distress to staff.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to replace the current system, by something less frustrating, would be to use automated recommendation engines.
I have tried Google Scholar recommendations and Pubchase and both work really well.
If we want to get rid of journals we need to figure out a way for such automated systems to mimic the journal's transfer of knowledge within and across communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working on an ongoing genome sequencing and assembly project, it is rather inconvenient when gene identifiers change from one build of the assembly to the next.
The gene labelling system described here, UniqTag, addresses this common challenge.
UniqTag assigns a unique identifier to each gene that is a representative &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;-mer, a string of length &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;, selected from the sequence of that gene.
Unlike serial numbers, these identifiers are stable between different assemblies and annotations of the same data without requiring that previous annotations be lifted over by sequence alignment.
We assign UniqTag identifiers to ten builds of the Ensembl human genome spanning eight years to demonstrate this stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, I assumed that excellent work would transcend the need for clever marketing and charismatic presentation to sell it to the proper audience, but the longer I work in science, the more I see examples of necessary hard work labeled as incremental and dismissed and attention lavished on the well constructed story.
The veracity of which appears secondary, or is assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, my fellow scientists: ask not what you can do for reproducibility; ask what reproducibility can do for you!
Here, I present five reasons why working reproducibly pays off in the long run and is in the self-interest of every ambitious, career-oriented scientist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do we mean when we say a DOI makes something ‘citable?’
If this is shorthand for the properties we would want in something citable: persistent identifier, archival content, machine-readable metadata, than we should start to recognize other things that share these features.
Further innovation requires valuing the features the DOI provides, not simply a “brand name” researchers recognize.&lt;/p&gt;
