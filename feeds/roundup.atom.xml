I had to take a break from updating the blog over the last few months with my dissertation in beast mode.
Now that the stress from that is gone (woo hoo!), I'm going to try to get back in the habit.
I may still be digging up older reads for a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now for the links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://jxyzabc.blogspot.com/2016/05/why-its-not-academias-job-to-produce.html"&gt;This post about academic CS and software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes sense that people expect academic research results to work in companies right away.
Research that makes tangible, measurable contributions is often what ends up being most popular with funding sources (including industry), media outlets, and other academics reviewing papers, faculty applications, and promotion cases.
As a result, academic researchers are increasingly under pressure to do research that can be described as "realistic" and "practical," to explicitly make connections between academic work and the real, practical work that goes on in industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure Jean fully appreciates the argument here.
I don't think people are clamoring for academic CS to produce industry-standard deployment-ready code.
They're arguing that code and data used as proof-of-concept for their research should be made freely available.
If it can't be openly evaluated and scrutinized, it's not science, it's anecdote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://academiccomputing.wordpress.com/2016/05/06/a-case-for-publishing-research-software/"&gt;This perfect counterpoint to the previous post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week Andy Ko made available his Citrus/Barista structured editor from the 2000s.
I downloaded and ran it: the binary did run, but it spat out repeated exceptions and I wasn’t sure if that was impairing the functioning of the software.
Thankfully, Ko didn’t just publish a binary: he published the source code.
For this, I salute him.
I went to modify the source code and it turned out not to compile with a modern Java compiler.
After some tweaks I got it compiling, and then fixed the exception.
Because the code was on github, one accepted pull request later and the software in his repository will now compile and run on a modern machine.
&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; — this is how software research should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/04/13/science-fairs-white-house/"&gt;This post about science fairs and privilege&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience turned out well, but it also left me queasy.
The only reason Veronica was able to carry out her experiment was that I had the flexibility to spend hours struggling through paperwork, and because I had a social network of scientists I’ve developed as a science writer.
This was an exercise in privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Veronica had been the daughter of a single parent with a couple jobs and no connections to the world of science — if she had been like a lot of American kids, in other words — her idea would have gone up in smoke.
She might not have even bothered thinking about the science fair at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl hits on the fact that science fairs are much better at identifying the students with the best social supports than they are at identifying the brightest or most curious students.
There are a lot of directions we could take this social commentary.
Personally, it's very encouraging to know that supporting my children with my time and social connections can have a huge positive impact on their success.
On the flip side, I feel a huge responsibility for young people around me that are not so fortunate.
How can I best fulfill my responsibility to support these budding bright young minds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2016/04/27/r-intimidated/"&gt;This pitch for a short R course developed by a high school student&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her interest in R grew out of a project where she and her fellow students and teachers went to the Canadian sub-Arctic to collect data on permafrost depth and polar bears.
When analyzing the data she learned R (with the help of a teacher) to be able to do the analyses, some of which she did on her laptop while out in the field.
Later she worked on developing a course that she felt was friendly and approachable enough for her fellow high-schoolers to benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the previous article was fresh on my mind when I read this one.
It is indeed remarkable what young people can do given support and access!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://genomebio.org/correction-expression/"&gt;This little demo about error correction and RNA-Seq quantification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does read error correction effect gene expression estimation?
tl;dr: no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat-744659addf7d#.bib9kcksq"&gt;This post about group chat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of academic research groups hopping on the Slack/Gitter train.
This post makes some good points about what group chat is/isn't good for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I still think group chat is an important tool in the communications toolbox.
I just don’t think it’s the go-to tool.
I think it’s the exception tool.
It’s far more useful for special cases than general cases.
When used appropriately, sparingly, and in the right context at the right time, it’s great.
You just really have to contain it, know when not to use it, and watch behavior and mood otherwise it can take over and mess up a really good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scicurious.org/why-wont-you-pay-to-read/"&gt;This post about paying (or not paying) to support science journalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll admit that I use an ad blocker plugin for my web browser.
But I am more than happy to disable it for news sites that prove (or promise) that they will not overwhelm me with megabytes of distracting interactive advertising with each page load.
And the author of this post has it right regarding the economics of science journalism: we can't have it both ways.
We don't get to complain about the poor quality of reporting while at the same time refusing to pay for quality science writing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/opinion/sunday/the-real-reason-college-tuition-costs-so-much.html"&gt;This post on the economics of college education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is disingenuous to call a large increase in public spending a “cut,” as some university administrators do, because a huge programmatic expansion features somewhat lower per capita subsidies.
Suppose that since 1990 the government had doubled the number of military bases, while spending slightly less per base.
A claim that funding for military bases was down, even though in fact such funding had nearly doubled, would properly be met with derision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, increased spending has not been going into the pockets of the typical professor.
Salaries of full-time faculty members are, on average, barely higher than they were in 1970.
Moreover, while 45 years ago 78 percent of college and university professors were full time, today half of postsecondary faculty members are lower-paid part-time employees, meaning that the average salaries of the people who do the teaching in American higher education are actually quite a bit lower than they were in 1970.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, a major factor driving increasing costs is the constant expansion of university administration.
According to the Department of Education data, administrative positions at colleges and universities grew by 60 percent between 1993 and 2009, which Bloomberg reported was 10 times the rate of growth of tenured faculty positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this (I'm risking posting half the article here!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid increase in college enrollment can be defended by intellectually respectable arguments.
Even the explosion in administrative personnel is, at least in theory, defensible.
On the other hand, there are no valid arguments to support the recent trend toward seven-figure salaries for high-ranking university administrators, unless one considers evidence-free assertions about “the market” to be intellectually rigorous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What cannot be defended, however, is the claim that tuition has risen because public funding for higher education has been cut.
Despite its ubiquity, this claim flies directly in the face of the facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://cameronneylon.net/blog/the-signal-and-the-noise-the-problem-of-reproducibility/"&gt;This post on how reproducibility is and should be defined, discussed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the solution may lie in a separation of concerns.
We need much greater clarity in the distinction between “described well enough to re-do” and “seems to be consistent in repeated tests”.
We need to maintain those distinctions for each of the different levels above: replication, reproduction and generalisation.
All of these in turn are separate to the question of whether a claim is true, or the universe (or our senses) reliable, or the social context and power relations that guided the process of claim making and experiment.
It is at the intersections between these different issues that things get interesting: does the design of an experiment may answer a general question, or is it much more specific?
Is the failure to get the same result, or our expectation of how often we “should” get the same result a question of experimental design, what is true, or the way our experience guides us to miss, or focus on specific issues?
In our search for reliable, and clearly communicated, results have we actually tested a different question to the one that really matters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disproving a claim using the same data is what reproducibility is all about, and this is one of the most important reasons that data needs to be shared.
After all, if someone has distorted their data in order to reach a conclusion that isn't really justified, we need someone else–someone not invested in proving the same result–to re-analyze the data using independent methods.
This is how science corrects itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/4443"&gt;This post on open educational resources (OER)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anderson goes on to critique OER:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A big issue for the open source movement has been its sustainability.
And that’s one of the reasons you’re seeing a lot of legislation about it because they are looking basically to the taxpayer,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to hear more of this criticism of OER from publishers and AAP in the future. Why?
The US PIRG’s recent report &lt;a href="http://www.uspirg.org/reports/usp/covering-cost"&gt;Covering the Cost&lt;/a&gt; estimates that each year approximately $3B – that’s $3,000,000,000US – of financial aid dollars are spent by undergraduates on textbooks and other proprietary educational materials.
In other words, under the existing commercial textbook model students are simply valves through which taxpayer dollars flow to publishers.
I would love the opportunity to get this number in front of more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://pyformat.info/"&gt;This HowTo on Python string formatting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python has had awesome string formatters for many years but the documentation on them is far too theoretic and technical.
With this site we try to show you the most common use-cases covered by the old and new style string formatting API with practical examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2016/02/16/when-it-comes-to-science-its-the-economy-stupid/"&gt;This post suggesting we fund science by lottery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m very confident in a peer review to detect the difference between psuedo-science and real science, or complete hype and realistic improvement.
But I’m much less confident in the ability of peer review to accurately distinguish “important” from “not important” research.
So I think we should consider seriously the lottery for these grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year all eligible scientists who meet some minimum entry requirements submit proposals for what they’d like to do scientifically.
Each year those proposals are reviewed to make sure they meet the very minimum bar (are they scientific? do they have relevant training at all?).
Among all the (very large) class of people who pass that bar we hold a lottery.
We take the number of research dollars and divide it up to give the maximum number of these grants possible.
These grants might be pretty small - just enough to fund the person’s salary and maybe one or two students/postdocs.
To make this works for labs that required equipment there would have to be cooperative arrangements between multiple independent indviduals to fund/sustain equipment they needed.
Renewal of these grants would happen as long as you were posting your code/data online, you were meeting peer review requirements, and responding to inquires about your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;These posts on Sci-Hub and open access to research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.comicsgrid.com/2016/02/sci-hub-not-open-access/"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; claiming that Sci-Hub has brought much-needed attention to an important issue, but that it is not a long-term solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://engineuring.wordpress.com/2016/02/24/why-sci-hub-is-the-true-solution-for-open-access-reply-to-criticism/"&gt;This response&lt;/a&gt; to the original post, from the Sci-Hub founder, which comes across as pretty reactionary and defensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://bjoern.brembs.net/2016/02/sci-hub-as-necessary-effective-civil-disobedience/"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; which doesn't (ostensibly) take any sides on the debate, but describes Sci-Hub as necessary civil disobedience and (in my opinion) highlights the good from both previous arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;These threads on compiling GCC with OpenMP support on OS X.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was having trouble installing CD-HIT this week with Homebrew.
These two StackOverflow threads (&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/29109926/459780"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/23490170/459780"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) led me to the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;brew reinstall gcc --without-multilib
brew install --build-from-source cd-hit
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="reproducibility"></category><category term="open"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="funding"></category><category term="homebrew"></category></entry><entry><title>Reading roundup</title><link href="https://standage.github.io/reading-roundup-2016-02-12.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-02-12T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-02-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Daniel S.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use SBTs to search 2,652 human blood, breast and brain RNA-seq experiments for all 214,293 known transcripts in under 4 days using less than 239 MB of RAM and a single CPU.
Searching sequence archives at this scale and in this time frame is currently not possible using existing tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/p-e-w/maybe"&gt;This nifty Python package for vetting shell scripts before running them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;maybe&lt;/strong&gt; allows you to run a command and see what it does to your files without actually doing it!
After reviewing the operations listed, you can then decide whether you really want these things to happen or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002333"&gt;This meta-analysis reporting the dismal state of reproducibility in biomedical literature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emphasis mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this survey, we assessed the current status of reproducibility and transparency addressing these indicators in a random sample of 441 biomedical journal articles published in 2000–2014.
Only one study provided a full protocol &lt;strong&gt;and none made all raw data directly available&lt;/strong&gt;.
Replication studies were rare (n = 4), and only 16 studies had their data included in a subsequent systematic review or meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03031"&gt;This preprint suggesting the use of sequence alignment as the basis for a cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, since HTS read mapping requires substantial computational resources and fast analysis turnout is desired, Coinami uses the HTS read mapping as proof-of-work to generate valid blocks to main its own cryptocurrency system, which may help motivate volunteers to dedicate more resources.
The Coinami protocol includes mechanisms to ensure that jobs performed by volunteers are correct, and provides genomic data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://mikethemadbiologist.com/2016/02/08/what-does-reproducibility-mean/"&gt;This blog post bemoaning the lack of nuance in the discussion of reproducibility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What bothers me about the reproducibility discussion is that, for the most part, we’re not discussing what reproducibility would and should mean, but rather it’s more along the lines of ALL TEH SCIENTISMZ ARE BROKEN!
Which makes for great pundity thinky-pieces, but doesn’t really help us do science within the real-world constraints that scientists experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't have a &lt;code&gt;.wav/.mp3&lt;/code&gt; file handy, but a terminal bell (&lt;code&gt;\a&lt;/code&gt;) works just as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; ! curl -m &lt;span class="m"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; http://www.example.com/&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; still down&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; sleep &lt;span class="m"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;$&amp;#39;\a\a\a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/do-the-new-big-money-science-prizes-work"&gt;This article about how big money science prizes are Doing It Wrong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a larger problem is that these prizes are not an efficient use of funds.
Instead of funding science prizes, these billionaires should try funding the science itself.
Take particle physics—one of the main specialties in which Breakthrough Prizes have been awarded.
In that field, government funding has been cut back significantly, and budgets have been flat or declining for years.
The $27 million awarded by Yuri Milner, in 2012, would have funded perhaps two hundred and seventy new postdoctoral fellowships that year, or a smaller number of postdoctoral fellowships combined with endowed faculty positions.
That could more than double the current number of young researchers in the field.
With a larger group of young, talented, and ambitious scientists finding gainful employment, the likelihood of jumpstarting some new and exciting research would be significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't agree with the idea to create tons more postdocs: the 2000s-era doubling of the NIH budget created a lot of Ph.D. studentships and postdoctoral fellowships but did not significantly change the landscape for permanent academic faculty and staff positions.
If you want to help the system, don't contribute to the attrition problem by funding more Ph.D.s or postdocs, mitigate it by creating more permanent career options for those already in the system!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160202/ncomms10448/full/ncomms10448.html"&gt;This new paper in &lt;em&gt;Nature Comms&lt;/em&gt; reporting genetic profile of a "morning person"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conduct a genome-wide association analysis of self-reported morningness, followed by analyses of biological pathways and related phenotypes.
We identify 15 significantly associated loci, including seven near established circadian genes...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://mattgemmell.com/the-dao-of-the-shell/"&gt;This blog post on the "Dao of the shell"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t take your fingers off the keyboard, because the mouse isn’t going to help you.
Everything is customisable and configurable… or you can equally just leave it alone.
The whole ethos of configuration on the shell is to set up an environment where you type less.
That’s a beautiful thing.
On a GUI, configuration is often just about giving you more stuff to drag a pointer over to, and then click upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with the sentiment: I spend a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of time in the shell, and it's as focusing and empowering as he describes.
But I think mutt is a horrible example to demonstrate this!
In my experience it's a huge pain to get working correctly, the documentation is sparse, and trying to piece together a sensible configuration from a dozen similar but slightly inconsistent neckbeard blog posts is not my idea of zen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/basic-science-can-t-survive-without-government-funding/"&gt;This piece arguing basic science's need for government funding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without government support, most basic scientific research will never happen.
This is most clearly true for the kind of pure research that has delivered enormous prestige and great intellectual benefits but no profits, such as the work that brought us the Higgs boson, or the understanding that a supermassive black hole sits at the center of the Milky Way, or the discovery of methane seas on the surface of Saturn's moon Titan.
Company research laboratories used to do this kind of work: experimental evidence for the big bang was discovered at AT&amp;amp;T's Bell Labs, resulting in a Nobel Prize.
Now those days are gone.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Even in applied fields, such as materials science and computer science, companies now understand that basic research is a form of charity—so they avoid it.
Scientists at Bell Labs created the transistor, but that invention earned billions for Intel (and Microsoft).
Engineers at Xerox PARC invented the modern graphical user interface, although Apple (and Microsoft) profited the most.
IBM researchers pioneered the use of giant magnetoresistance to boost hard-disk capacity but soon lost the disk-drive business to Seagate and Western Digital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the experiment a step further, the researchers found that the interbred strains tended to be more hardy inside the wasp gut then those that were not—over time, the pure breeds actually died off.
This, the researchers claim, proves that wasp gut reproduction is a major driver of yeast diversity in nature.
And , they add, that suggests that yeast are dependent on interaction with insects for evolutionary development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Career paths in software engineering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In academia in particular, this is a big challenge.
Faculty members, students, postdocs, and staff members may all be developing scientific software.
But, university employees, at all levels, who are interested in both science and software often feel compelled to leave academia due to the lack of recognition of their software activities and the lack of career paths that let them pursue their interests in a manner that they feel is sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON DC – At a human genomics meeting today, there was widespread relief during the fourth talk of the day, when the bioinformaticist that was speaking told the audience “I am not going to go through the details of my algorithm”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, software has diseconomies of scale.
The more we build, the more expensive it becomes to build and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for those current students, I hope they can do as I didn’t.
When I was a student, I spent little time thinking about and planning for what would come after.
I was deeply unprepared for the world of paid employment.
I was unprepared psychologically to transition to non-academic work, but I was also unprepared for the practical aspects of career exploration and job searching.
I had never conducted an informational interview before.
I didn’t have a resume.
I had no idea that most applicants were networking their way to interviews, not simply applying cold.
And I was just as unprepared for the socio-cultural aspects of non-academic employment: working 9-5 in an office with colleagues who understood, implicitly, how one comports oneself as a professional in that environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some good parts, but honestly I'm not sure what point this guy's trying to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholars want to pursue their research, unencumbered by headaches and heartache, and they want to communicate the results of their scholarship to the brightest and most interested students around.
Is that so much to ask?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. It is.
At least if the person asking is an adult.
Before grad school, I worked for a talented screenwriter.
I watched her career get trod upon by Hollywood executives with stupid suggestions and even stupider commands.
Likewise, a friend’s father had his law career stifled by office politics and collegial jealousy.
The fact is that no profession is perfect.
Young architects dream of erecting museums but spend more time redesigning kitchens.
Even the "dream" professions are not immune: Aren’t movie stars always complaining about having to answer inane questions in pointless interviews?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great irony is that so many of the academics who complain about the corporatization of universities run off to get corporate jobs, where all the problems these scholars link to corporatizing trends — one would presume — would be present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I learned from the internet is that nothing upsets my male colleagues more than the pernicious sexual harassment that has been happening right under their noses for years.
“What kind of world are we living in?” they wail, “And what can I do about it?”
Ever since I can remember, I’ve actually been a woman, and so maybe I can offer some constructive advice.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trend will be familiar to anyone who has looked at admission rates to top universities.
Despite ever-rising tuition costs and the growth of much-cheaper online alternatives, the highest-status universities keep getting more selective.
The best way to understand this, I think, is to see both academic journals and top universities less as purveyors of information or knowledge than as dispensers of status.
Information may want to be free, but status will always be scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2016-sustaining-research-software-development.html"&gt;This blog post on sustaining research software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software is fast becoming a &lt;em&gt;sine qua non&lt;/em&gt; in research, and researchers and funding agencies have been trying with increasing urgency to figure out how to support sustainable software development.
There's a whole NSF program devoted to sustainable research software, and I think it's fair to say that one of the main subsurface goals of the BD2K program is to tackle the question of software (PSA: data isn't much use without software).
The USDA and bio bits of DOE are also running smack into the problem that the research programs they fund are utterly dependent on software, yet investments in software are often secondary and rarely yield software that is usable past the end of the grant.
It turns out that software development for research is a rather intransigent beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/11/16/031930.abstract"&gt;This preprint on the state of software in (evolutionary) biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A topic that has received little attention in this context is the code quality of widely used codes.
Unfortunately, the majority of users tend to blindly trust software and the results it produces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://drhagen.com/blog/the-missing-11th-of-the-month/"&gt;This interesting analysis of references to dates and a suprising effect from OCR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where did the rest of the missing 11th go?
Well, starting in the 1860s, the Google algorithm starts to make a rather peculiar error—it misreads 11th as nth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2015/nov/26/why-combining-science-and-showmanship-risks-the-future-of-research"&gt;This Guardian article on showmanship in science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many years, medicine, dinosaurs, space travel, and human origins have all been highly visible and widely entertaining scientific topics.
And for many years, we have relied on evaluation by editorial and professional peer review in scientific journals, evaluative reporting by science journalists, and individual judgment of educated citizens to place new scientific claims into proper perspective.
?Under those conditions, the trend toward science showmanship was arguably tolerable because it usually rested on a foundation of solid science.
When it doesn’t, it becomes bad reality TV that pleases sponsors but shouldn’t be confused for knowledge about process or result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study at Google found five key dynamics that make for successful teams within the company: psychological safety, dependability, structure &amp;amp; clarity, meaning of work, and impact of work.
These findings can be adapted to improving research group dynamics in academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...and the disproportionate pressure on women who hope to have children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt any selection committee would admit on-record to thinking a family-free candidate is “perfect”.
Nonetheless, the traditional academic career structure is built around an assumption of mobility that is hard to maintain with any kind of relationships or dependents.
I’m still trying to figure out if I can manage to keep a pet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10822376"&gt;This thread on Hacker News about video-based MOOCs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've participated in two MOOCs, but didn't complete either.
I have mixed feelings about the use of video to present the material.
In some cases, I could easily do without it.
But in other cases I think it was helpful.
Also, the types of autodidacts (many/most with a strong technical background already) that thrive in MOOCs may not need/want video as much as the average learner that would really benefit the most from a free or low-cost course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2016, I realised that video based courses in Coursera and Udemy are not ideal and are a drain on efficiency.
You cannot skim through content in videos and you are constantly wondering what you will miss if you forward the video.
You will have to adjust to lecturer's speed rather than choose your own speed.
You cannot listen to videos in noisy environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26711672/"&gt;This study on whether mom's kisses really do make owies feel better&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND: The practice of maternal kissing of minor injuries of childhood (boo-boos), though widely endorsed and practised, has never been demonstrated to be of benefit to children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy, if any, of maternal kissing of boo-boos in toddlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But earlier this year, an announcement in the &lt;a href="http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/"&gt;Zootaxa&lt;/a&gt; academic journal that two new species of large gecko &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.3980.1.4"&gt;had been found in southern China&lt;/a&gt; contained a strange omission: the species’ whereabouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Due to the popularity of this genus as novelty pets, and recurring cases of scientific descriptions driving herpetofauna to near-extinction by commercial collectors, we do not disclose the collecting localities of these restricted-range species in this publication,” the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I know what you are thinking – “Yuk, I don’t want a job at the University of Southwestern Northern Nunavut.”
Neither do I, but here is the important thing to remember: &lt;strong&gt;You are not marrying your institution – you are dating it&lt;/strong&gt;.
If you don’t like it, you can leave – at any time and for any reason.
The key is to get yourself into a job where you can prove your abilities as an independent researcher, get your start-up money, get a grant, do some teaching, and so on.
That can happen at nearly any university in nearly any state or country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/351/6268/14.full"&gt;This (paywalled?!?!) article about the NHGRI possibly terminating funding for several model organism databases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NHGRI Director Eric Green says that nothing has been decided and that rumors that his institute plans to phase out all of its funding are incorrect.
But he and other NIH leaders are searching for ways to make the databases more efficient, and are urging databases to consider charging for use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need to read!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computationally, read duplicates are defined via their mapping position, which does not distinguish PCR from natural duplicates that are bound to occur for highly transcribed RNAs.
Hence, it is unclear how to treat duplicate reads and how important it is to reduce PCR amplification experimentally.
Here, we generate and analyse RNA-Seq datasets that were prepared with three different protocols (Smart-Seq, TruSeq and UMI-seq).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://donmelton.com/2015/12/21/what-the-new-video-compression-strategy-from-netflix-means-for-apple-and-amazon/"&gt;This blog post on Netflix's new video compression strategy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tl;dr of it all is simply that Netflix plans on scaling bitrates up and down based on the complexity of their video.
So, slightly higher bitrates for busy action blockbusters and possibly lower bitrates for relatively static, flat cartoons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically what we’ve all been doing for years with variable bitrate (VBR) encoding.
But they’re trying to control that variance a lot more than an encoder like x264 typically allows.
In fact, as near as I can tell, Netflix still plans on encoding everything with a constant bitrate (CBR), but they want to be really particular about the target number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do that, Netflix will transcode every one of their videos a bazillion times at different resolutions and at different bitrates, finally selecting the smallest one for a particular title that doesn’t suck visually.
Seriously, their algorithm for all of this is quite clever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we report that the &lt;em&gt;Anaphase Promoting Complex subunit 11 (APC11)&lt;/em&gt; gene in &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/em&gt; carries a constitutive single-nucleotide exon.
&lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; transcription and translation assays performed using &lt;em&gt;APC11-Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP)&lt;/em&gt; fusion constructs revealed that intron splicing surrounding the single-nucleotide exon is effective in both &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/em&gt; and rice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would argue that the analogy with wet lab work would be that &lt;strong&gt;designing experiments&lt;/strong&gt; is like &lt;strong&gt;designing software&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;conducting experiments&lt;/strong&gt; is like &lt;strong&gt;implementing software&lt;/strong&gt;.
Now if we follow the general agreement that designing experiments is a valuable intellectual input to the scientific endeavour, by analogy so should designing software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waddell&lt;/strong&gt;: In your paper, you compare the debate over nuclear science in the 1950s to the current debate over cryptography.
Nuclear weapons are one of the most obvious threats to humanity today—do you think surveillance presents a similar type of danger?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rogaway&lt;/strong&gt;: I do. It’s of a different nature, obviously.
The threat is more indirect and more subtle.
So with nuclear warfare, there was this visually compelling and frightening risk of going up in a mushroom cloud.
And with the transition to a state of total surveillance, what we have is just the slow forfeiture of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;King’s College London doesn’t want to release data to James Coyne from a study of chronic fatigue syndrome.
See if the absurd reasons make your blood boil as much as ours:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The university considers that there is a lack of value or serious purpose to your request.
The university also considers that there is improper motive behind the request.
The university considers that this request has caused and could further cause harassment and distress to staff.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to replace the current system, by something less frustrating, would be to use automated recommendation engines.
I have tried Google Scholar recommendations and Pubchase and both work really well.
If we want to get rid of journals we need to figure out a way for such automated systems to mimic the journal's transfer of knowledge within and across communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working on an ongoing genome sequencing and assembly project, it is rather inconvenient when gene identifiers change from one build of the assembly to the next.
The gene labelling system described here, UniqTag, addresses this common challenge.
UniqTag assigns a unique identifier to each gene that is a representative &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;-mer, a string of length &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;, selected from the sequence of that gene.
Unlike serial numbers, these identifiers are stable between different assemblies and annotations of the same data without requiring that previous annotations be lifted over by sequence alignment.
We assign UniqTag identifiers to ten builds of the Ensembl human genome spanning eight years to demonstrate this stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, I assumed that excellent work would transcend the need for clever marketing and charismatic presentation to sell it to the proper audience, but the longer I work in science, the more I see examples of necessary hard work labeled as incremental and dismissed and attention lavished on the well constructed story.
The veracity of which appears secondary, or is assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, my fellow scientists: ask not what you can do for reproducibility; ask what reproducibility can do for you!
Here, I present five reasons why working reproducibly pays off in the long run and is in the self-interest of every ambitious, career-oriented scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/2013/06/03/DOI-citable.html"&gt;This quote about DOIs and citability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do we mean when we say a DOI makes something ‘citable?’
If this is shorthand for the properties we would want in something citable: persistent identifier, archival content, machine-readable metadata, than we should start to recognize other things that share these features.
Further innovation requires valuing the features the DOI provides, not simply a “brand name” researchers recognize.&lt;/p&gt;
