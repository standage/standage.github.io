		<div><p>Today I took a break from my normal grind to attend a whole-day workshop on scholarly writing.
Duke University professor of rhetoric <a href="http://georgegopen.com/">George Gopen</a> discussed writing from the perspective of the reader, and the importance of honoring the reader's expectations about how prose is structured in communicating the correct interpretation of the writer's thinking.
I am very pleased I chose to attend, which is more than I can say for many campus workshops and seminars.
Gopen taught some very helpful principles, and his delivery kept the audience engaged for the grueling 9-hour duration of the workshop.
I was able to take down <em>some</em> notes during the workshop, but I'm afraid if I don't clean them up while they're fresh on my mind I'll lose some of the details.
So here is what I got out of the workshop.</p>
<h2>On the teaching of writing</h2>
<p>The composition curriculum is broken.
Students, for the most part, feel as if they are <em>demonstrating</em> their ability to write, rather than genuinely <em>communicating</em>.
Writing assessment does a poor job of determining whether the student actually communicated what she intended to communicate;
Rather, it determines whether <em>something</em> was communicated effectively.
In the current curriculum, the attention is focused on the writer's competence.</p>
<p>In the "real world" (which Gopen defines as what you do after the <em>last</em> time you graduate), the focus is reader and not the writer.
A litigator doesn't get brownie points in court for a horrible written submissions simply because it's an improvement over the last submission.
A scientist submitting a grant proposal doesn't get funded because his awful proposal is quite an improvement over his last awful proposal.
What matters is how well the scholarly writing conveys to the reader the writer's thinking, and then of course, the substance of that thinking.</p>
<h2>Problems with the reader's perspective</h2>
<p>So as we teach writing and think about writing, foremost consideration must be given to the reader's perspective.
However, there are problems with the reader's perspective.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you turn it over to the reader, you've lost control.
  They're going to do with it what they want, not what you want.</li>
<li>Every unit of discourse (phrase, paragraph, section, etc) is infinitely interpretable.
  Nothing has meaning without context and background experience.</li>
<li>If reader expectations about the structure of the prose are violated, they struggle to appropriately allocate their energy for reading and comprehension.
  Any time the reader reads a word, they read it in the context of a phrase, a sentence, a paragraph, a section, and the whole document.
  This is a <em>very</em> complex issue.</li>
<li>Reader energy is a zero-sum game:
  Any energy they've devoted to trying to figure out the <em>structure</em> of the writing is energy they cannot devote to comprehending the substance or content of the writing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gopen then proposes this as a the definition of bad professional/scholarly writing: Writing that requires a disproportionate amount of reader energy to determine structure rather than to comprehend content.</p>
<h2>Thesis</h2>
<p>After motivating the reader's perspective and discussing the issues related to it, Gopen presented this as the main thesis of the rest of the workshop.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Readers of contemporary English prose have relatively fixed expectations about where in the structure of a unit of discourse to look for the arrival of certain kinds of substance of the writing.
In other words, where the word is placed in a phrase or sentence conveys a lot of information about its content or substance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, there are four main questions the reader must answer about a particular unit of discourse to correctly interpret it.</p>
<ul>
<li>What's going on?</li>
<li>Whose story is this? Whose perspective?</li>
<li>How does this sentence fit in with the surrounding sentences?</li>
<li>Which word(s) in the sentence should I be reading with extra emphasis?</li>
</ul>
<p>One of my favorite of Gopen's claims is the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's insufficient for your writing to <em>be capable</em> of meaning what you intend it to mean:
It's only sufficient when your writing instructs the reader to understand <em>precisely</em> what you mean.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will not be there when an NSF grant review panel is reading your proposal.
You will not be able to give an oral performance placing all of the right emphasis in all the write places.
So you have to structure your writing so that your reader can't help but understand your meaning.</p>
<h2>Reader's attention to different units of discourse</h2>
<p>There are 3 units of discourse of which the writer needs to be concious.</p>
<ul>
<li>main clause (can stand on its on as a sentence)</li>
<li>qualifying clause (has a subject and verb but cannot stand as an independent sentence)</li>
<li>phrase (lacks a subject or verb or both, cannot stand alone)</li>
</ul>
<p>Readers naturally give the most attention to main clauses, less attention to qualifying clauses, and the least amount of attention to phrases.
Therefore, as a writer, you have to turn what you <em>mean</em> into main clauses, and make sure supporting ideas are in qualifying clauses, and so on.
Help the reader out by structuring your ideas to match how they read.</p>
<h2>Assorted notes on structure</h2>
<ul>
<li>the stress position: end of the sentence or clause</li>
<li>asdf</li>
</ul>
<h2>Assorted notes on grammatical "rules"</h2>
<ul>
<li>asdf</li>
</ul></div>
