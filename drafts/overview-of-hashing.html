		<div><p>Recently I've been digging into the internals of the <a href="https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/">khmer package</a> and how it handles DNA sequences.
While this is all fresh on my mind, I wanted to take a moment to discuss the topic from the layman's perspective.
This post reviews the two-bit encoding scheme used by khmer, <em>k</em>-mer hashing in general, the reason khmer is limited to <em>k</em>-mers ≤ 32 nucleotides in length, and the implications of our plan to support larger (possibly arbitrary) values of <em>k</em>.</p>
<h2>Two-bit representation of DNA sequences</h2>
<p>The most common convention for</p>
<p>The letters A, C, G, and T have long been used as shorthand for the nucleotides from which DNA sequences are composed.</p>
<p>Many research questions in genomics and bioinformatics ignore the fascinating biochemical properties and molecular structure of DNA and focus on its <em>primary sequence</em>.</p>
<p>DNA has many fascinating biochemical and biophysical properties</p>
<p>It is common practice in bioinformatics to ignore the biochemical and biophysical</p>
<p>Although DNA has a complex and intricate 3-dimensional structure,</p>
<p>a lot of genomics and bioinformatics research ignores this level of detail.
 the information stored in DNA depends</p>
<p>For a variety of (extremely uninteresting) reasons</p>
<p>When stored as text, DNA sequences require 8 bits (1 byte) per nucleotide: a 32 base pair sequence requires 256 bits of storage, a 1 kilobase sequence requires 8,000 bits (1,000 bytes or 1 kilobyte), and 1 megabase requires 8,000,000 bits (1,000,000 bytes or 1 megabyte) of storage.
This has to do with how computers store information.
Each character of text requires 8 bits of information.
Consider the text.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>|   G    |   A    |   T    |   T    |   A    |   C    |   A    |
|01000111|01000001|01010100|01010100|01000001|01000011|01000001|
</pre></div>


<p>However, if we hash each of these sequences to an integer value, we only require 64 bits (8 bytes) at most to store each one.
Recall that computers store information in binary format.</p>
<p>0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to hash a string to an integer value.
The scheme used by khmer is based on the observation that each individual nucleotide can be unambiguously represented using only 2 bits of information.
For example, if we map the nucleotides adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G) to the numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3</p>
<p>nice property: perfect hash</p>
<p>When working with</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  G  |  A  |  T  |  T  |  A  |  C  |  A  |
 1 1 | 0 0 | 0 1 | 0 1 | 0 0 | 1 0 | 0 0 |
</pre></div>


<p>Currently, khmer only supports</p>
<p>The bulk of the <a href="https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/">khmer package</a>'s functionality is devoted to data structures designed for querying the presence and abundance of <em>k</em>-mers (DNA sequences of a set length <em>k</em>).
khmer</p>
<p>Like many sequence analysis tools, the <a href="https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/">khmer package</a> relies on hashing <em>k</em>-mers (DNA sequences of a set length <em>k</em>).
Defined broadly, hashing is the process by which data of arbitrary size is transformed to an alternative fixed-size representation.
Within the scope of the khmer package, <em>k</em>-mer sequences stored as text are hashed into a numerical value (an unsigned 64 bit integer, specifically) for further processing.
This transformation serves two purposes: first, the integer representation of the sequence occupies much less memory than the text-based representation; and second, the integer representation is the value used to index into various data structures for storing and querying <em>k</em>-mer presence and abundance.</p>
<p>The khmer package uses a fairly common two-bit encoding scheme
Within the scope of the khmer package, <em>k</em>-mer hashing serves primary two purposes: first, it transforms DNA sequences from a text-based representation to a numerical representation that occupies much less memory (compression); and second,</p>
<p>Generally, hashing is a transformation of arbitrary data (DNA sequence stored as plain text) to a single numerical value.</p>
<p>Hashing has two purposes: first, it transforms character/string data into a numerical representation that occupies much less memory (compression), and it</p>
<p>I've been digging</p>
<p>All of these features depend on <em>k</em>-mer hashing.</p>
<p>Broadly defined, hashing is a process by which data of arbitrary size is transformed to an alternative fixed-size representation.
In khmer, <em>k</em>-mers stored initially as text are transformed into a numerical value (an unsigned 64 bit integer) for further processing.
Storing k-mer as integers rather than as text is much more space efficient, and the integer values can be used to index directly into the hash tables used for k-mer counting.</p>
<p>Recently I've been digging into the internals of the <a href="https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/">khmer package</a> and, in particular, its hashing scheme.
khmer uses the very common approach in bioinformatics of breaking DNA sequences into overlapping segments of length <em>k</em> called <em>k</em>-mers.
It then provides data structures for querying <em>k</em>-mer presence and abundance, as well as algorithms for data filtering and graph traversal.</p>
<p>Like many DNA sequence analysis tools, khmer uses a <em>hash function</em> to transform <em>k</em>-mers stored initially as text into a numerical value that occupies much less memory.
Currently, khmer can only support <em>k</em>-mers of length ≤ 32 nucleotides.
Here I discuss khmer's hashing function, the reasons for the 32 bp limit, and discuss how we might add support for larger (possibly arbitrary) value of <em>k</em>.</p></div>
